We are a group of passionate people who strive to bringing everyone information and provide a platform for others to express their creativity. We report on the major events and happenings, mostly limited to our campus. As a news body, we take the responsibility of generating awareness among our students. We promote the arts and organize contests which help budding talents. We publish creative works including poems, short stories, cartoons, photographs, etc.
