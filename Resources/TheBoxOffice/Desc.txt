The Box Office, Madras Institute of Technology official dramatics club, is the gateway to everything that unveils your ingenious side. This is the place to be if you like to act, direct, write, or pretty much do anything related to theatre and film art. The Box Office a.k.a TBO is the brain child of a group of pre-final year students who took the help of one of the most instrumental teaching staffs of MIT, Mr. A.R.S. Jayanth and convened the college's first official dramatics club.
